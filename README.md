## What is the goal of the project?
I want to create a website where you can login with Facebook (or some other social media site) and search for a person or an event and then remove all instances of it from your life. Currently FB has the option to search for people that you are friends with but not ex friends.

## Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
It's for anyone who wants to purge.

## What are your personal learning goals?
To solidify the concepts that we've learned with Postgres, Ruby/Rails, and APIs. 

## What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
Ruby/Rails. APIs. Login stuff.

## What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
Facebook's (or some other social media) API allowing me to do things.

## What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
At least showing the content that includes the search result.
